The New Barbarian Training System
3 months to influence, strength, and true manliness.
The Catholic man’s guide to becoming useful to your friends and dangerous to your enemies.

# Introducing the New Barbarian:

I’m Robert Storey. I’m a former Catholic seminarian, high school teacher, certified Underground Strength Coach, and uncle of 11, and founder of the New Barbarian Tribe (stick with me and I’ll explain the name in good time). I’ve been working in men’s ministry for nearly a decade, and I’ve seen the frustration of good men who just can’t figure out how to be great. 

And it is no surprise we are frustrated. We are in a cultural crisis. Men are not acting like men should. It’s time we do something about it and raise ourselves, and those around us to the height of our potential.

If you are like me, then you think that there is more to this life than picking up chicks, playing video games, watching Netflix, or getting a six pack. There is a war, and we are in the midst of it. But it is a war that is hard as hell to know how to fight.

I think that is the crisis. It’s not that men don’t want to be great, it’s that most of us don’t know how, and even for those of us that do, it is so much easier to take it easy.

Men want to be movers and shakers; men want to contribute to society; men have been told a hundred different messages as to why they can’t, why they aren’t worthy, why they aren’t capable. They are worthy, and even though they may not be capable yet, there is no reason they cannot be with a little hard work.

We are meant to change this world brothers. We are meant to shape it for good. St. Catherine of Siena said, “Be who God meant you to be and you will set the world on fire.” This is what we were made for, we just need to learn how and then develop the skills and virtues we need to fulfill this task. I’ve come a long way on this journey myself, and I chose to become an educator and a coach so that I could help others walk this path.


## What Kind of Man Will You Be?

In my work, and in my experience, I have seen two major corruptions in our societies view of men. Different parts of the culture feed us one of two different errors. When we ask, what is it to be a man, we are told:

“Being a man means being powerful. It means taking what you want. Dominating others, getting chicks, being the start. You aren’t a man unless you got big muscles, a bigger bench, and an even bigger paycheck. A man doesn’t tie himself down, but feeds all of his desires.”

Or alternately

“Being a real man means being supportive and compassionate. A true man is loving and humble and is a gentleman. He doesn’t offend others, but takes their point of view rather than his own. He doesn’t force himself upon others or his environment. He is safe; he is harmless.”

Myself? I’ve floated between the two. I’ve been the brute. Athletic, muscular, wrestler, and devoid of virtue. I’ve used my strength to gain status and little more. I was constantly on the lookout for those I could beat, to rise a little in the ranking. I would gladly sell others down the river for my own interest. I was a selfish jerk.

Then one day I injured my shoulder and had to quit wrestling. Fortunately, this opened up time for me to get more involved in theater and youth group, and since I didn’t have anything else to do, I jumped in. There were some good people there. It was one of the most welcoming places I’ve ever been, but it caused me to swing too far in the opposite direction. I became soft (read skinny fat) and weak. I was a good guy, but I wasn’t useful. I didn’t have the strength of will or the confidence to challenge the status quo. 

I don’t find either of these versions of me very attractive. The first may be powerful, but he is RULED by his desires, RULED by the opinion of others; he is NOT his own master. He is a hulking brute. He is an overgrown and selfish child. The second isn’t much better. He is a wimp. No one fears him; after all, he is safe and would never stand up to conflict. No one listens to him; he is a better listener anyway. 

After high school I decided to change, and in college I discovered how. 

I became dangerous. I developed confidence. I found my spine. But it was no longer about me. I was a missionary, then a seminarian, then a teacher. My life is not my own. I have a mission, given by another, and I have had to challenge myself to overcome sin, selfishness, and weakness, while at the same time relying on the strength of God, since I don’t have enough on my own. I needed to build virtue to gain the freedom I need to work for God’s purpose. This is True Masculinity. Strength FOR OTHERS. FOR GOD. FOR FRIENDS. FOR FAMILY. It is the middle ground between these corruptions. Courage and Humility. Strength and Meekness. And wherever you think you might fall, there is no need for you to stay there. You can become dangerous; you can become tame. You can be a great man.

I learned from the experts of culture, the Greeks, and the Christians of the 7th, 8th, and 9th centuries taught me how to incorporate that into the Christian worldview.

I know I am meant to be a better man. I know I am made for greatness. And you are meant to be great as well. 

“There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilization—these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat.” –C.S. Lewis
I have been shown how to get there, and I will show you. Now it is just a journey.

## Become a Barbarian, become an Emperor 

I don’t want’ to be a wimp, and I don’t want to be a brute. I don’t want to be a gentleman. I want to be dangerous. I want to be a barbarian.

Barbarians have gotten a bad wrap, but they are the perfect model for the modern Catholic man. They are dangerous, they are powerful, they are influential, just like the brute, but (if we look to the right tribes) barbarians are also humble students, eager to become civilized in their own way. They came to the Roman Empire, not to destroy the Romans, but to be incorporated into that culture. So much so that some even rose to become Emperor. They rose to this by being both magnanimous and humble. These are the two foundational virtues of the Barbarian.

Humility is something you are probably familiar with, though you may not fully understand what it means in your life. Humility is having a true vision of who and what you are. It is the recognition that you don’t have all of what it takes. It is realizing that you have work to do. It is realizing that at every moment you are dependent upon others, both God and other men and women. You are not self-sufficient. You are not a self-made-man.

But this must be balanced by magnanimity, which you may not have ever heard of before. Magnanimity is from the Latin words magna and anima: great and soul. So to be magnanimous is to be great-souled. It is to be large, in a sense. It is to be worthy of great things, and to know that you are worthy of great things. And you are all worthy. You are all sons of God, granted great talents, which need to be mastered and put to a great use.

These balance each other out, and barbarians knew this. They realized that they were not a part of a great culture. They were not educated. But they were worthy of the highest places in the Empire, even the seat of the emperor itself. But they needed to be raised into that glory. They were capable students, but students all the same.

## Finding Our Heritage

As Westerners, we have forgotten what it means to be students. We all think that we know best and that we are capable of deciding what is right and wrong all on our own. We think we can determine our own truth. We say that no one can be our judge. We don’t think we need training, we don’t think there is anything higher than ourselves, so we have rejected our heritage.

We have forgotten our Greek heritage; we have rejected our Christian foundation. We are the descendants of Western Civilization, but we are no longer its heirs. We are no longer living in that tradition. We need to reclaim this if we want to be great again. We need to reclaim our Greek and Christian Tradition.

Plato, an ancient Greek philosopher, understood education. He knew that it was much more than forcing facts down student’s throats and testing them on things they won’t remember next week. Education is about forming the whole person, body, mind, and soul. It is about giving us a foundation from which we are capable thinkers and communicators. People who can live in and contribute to community. People who have learned to dialogue. With this goal in mind, he set up his educational model around two things, physical training and Mousike. 

Physical training makes you a better citizen and soldier by making you more physically capable and by training your virtues and emotions to be more willing to do what is necessary, no matter the cost. It helps connect you to the realness and difficulty present in the world, and it gives you tools to make it better. It makes you less of a wimp.

Mousike (which doesn’t translate well into English) makes you more loyal and compassionate, so that you don’t become so focused on winning that you destroy everything you love. It makes you better able to understand others so that you can dialogue and come towards the OBJECTIVE TRUTH. It makes you less of a brute.

But Plato was missing one piece. He lacked the best tool to give direction to a man’s life. He was one of the best at creating high functioning men, but he didn’t fully understand where to send them or what tasks to put them to. 

This is where Judeo-Christianity comes in. If we want to know the best way to make use of an object, who better to ask than the inventor. In the early centuries AD, Christians completed the Greek picture of education and gave direction to men’s lives. A more significant purpose than protecting the city. We deal with eternal relation to our God and the salvation of the souls of those around us.

It was the barbarian tribes who took these three elements and gave them a dynamism far beyond anything they had ever had. That is why we are the New Barbarians. We are dangerous. We are uncivilized. But we are eager students. We see a tradition that is not our own, and we will enter into it anew. 

## What will you choose?

Will you remain complacent? Will you live a life without strength? Without direction? Without purpose?

Or will you commit to your training, body, mind, and soul?

This is a lifelong journey, but are you bold enough to take the first step?

“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God.” -Marianne Williamson
